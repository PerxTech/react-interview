# Interview

Using the [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/), create a web application that retrieves and displays the user's repositories and
organizations that he/she belongs to in Github. And deploy the project somewhere
and host the source code on your Github profile. The application in a nutshell
would include an input to enter the username, a section to display the list of
repositories and another section that displays the organizations.
